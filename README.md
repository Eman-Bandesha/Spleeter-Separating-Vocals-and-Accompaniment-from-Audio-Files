# Spleeter: Separating Vocals and Accompaniment from Audio Files

Spleeter is a pre-trained deep learning model developed by Deezer for audio source separation. It can separate vocals (lyrics) and accompaniment (sound) from music tracks.

## Installation
You can install Spleeter and its dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install spleeter
```

## Advanced Options
 - **Choose Number of Stems:** You can choose between 2 stems (vocals/accompaniment) or 4 stems (vocals/drums/bass/other).
 - **Customize Model:** Spleeter provides several pre-trained models with different capabilities. You can experiment with different models to achieve the desired separation quality.
 - **Adjust Parameters:** You can adjust various parameters such as sample rate, bitrate, etc., to optimize the separation process for your specific audio files.

## Notes
 - Spleeter is a powerful tool, but it might not always produce perfect separation, especially with complex audio sources.
 - Experimentation and fine-tuning may be necessary to achieve the desired separation quality.
 - For more information and advanced usage, refer to the official Spleeter documentation.
